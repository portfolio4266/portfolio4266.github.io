                    <div class="text">
                        <p>I started in the marine industry on a vessel converted into a crab processing plant called the M/V Northland in order to put tuition together to finish my degree in Aerodynamics. I quickly discovered working on the decks of these
                            vessels was much more profitable than working below decks in the factories below decks. While working the decks of these vessels I found the physical challenges to be more than ANYTHING I've ever done in my life (even to this
                            day). There is no work that I am aware of that is as challenging or dangerous. Being a part of a TEAM and learning how to work as a team is paramount to not only your success, but also to you survival...and I'm not speaking
                            figuratively. This is serious business!&nbsp; </p>
                        <h2>Offshore Supply</h2>
                        <p>After several years in commercial fishing I made a shift to the offshore supply sector of the maritime industry. This is a highly regulated industry where you are dealing with dynamic projects, some of which the procedures are
                            writen based upon what issues you encounter and how you deal with them. as with everything in Maritime, this is a TEAM sport. Everyone needs to be on the same page to avoid accidents that could lead to an ecological disaster
                            or even worse...injury or death of a crew member. In the oil fields of the Gulf of Mexico I honed my skills as a boat handler learning from mariner experienced in this particular field. Although I knew how to safely drive a
                            boat before I came to the Gulf, OSV work require a certain skill set exclusive to the type of work performed. Your main focus (besides safety) is to get the vessel close enough to the project platform to perform your scheduled
                            op without making contact with the platform itsself. This can be a tricky and dangerous task, so experience and vigilence are the operative words here.</p>
                        <p>After 4yrs serving as a bridge officer, I was given my first command. I have led men almost my entire career at sea so with the exception of the mission this was not new for me. The main difference is when you make the move from
                            bridge officer to Vessel Master you are now responsible for the entire operation. Scheduling, maintaining time tables, daily project reports to all parties involved become your mandate. Thisalong with managing you crew and
                            the different crews of contractors brought on to complete a job. Here is where teamwork and strong, open communications are especially important. On large scale projects several different crews are employed to do specific task.
                            These crews come from different companies all of whom have different rules underwhich they operate. These may not necessarily always fall in line with the vessel/company rules. As vessel master it was my responsibility to ensure
                            my companies rules were followed as everyone was on our vessel thus my responsibility. I found as long as clear instruction is given along with a detailed overview of the project objectives, many issues were avoided before
                            they became problems. For me, communication has always been the key to a good team dynamic. No crewman has EVER been injured while serving under my command. </p>

                        <p>After a 25yr career at sea I decided to go a different direction and pursue a career in tech. Having been surounded by tech either through our onboard equipment, or the ROV's we sometimes carry for special projects, my interest
                            has grown to the point that I wanted to get involved. Now as I discover this new world I bring lessons learned and hope to find a situation that allows me to do what I do best...what I've always done. </p>
