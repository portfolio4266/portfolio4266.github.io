                        <p>Hello all, and welcome to to my landing page. This was started as a 201 class project at Code Fellows when I was first learning to code. All images on this page were taken by me at sea during the projects as there were ongoing.
                            Video clips of commercial fishing vessels (contained in various links) were taken onboard vessels that I served on as bosun. Now they, along with this site, will serve as a reminder of how far I've come. I hope you gain as
                            much insight from reading it as I do every time I update it. </p>

                            along with additional quarters to house a 3rd party crew who attended to the equipment and the scrubbing operation. My deck crew was tasked with making certain that all company environmental safety standards were strictly maintained,
                            while my bridge team's task was to hold the vessel in one position while the operation was performed using the vessels <a href="http://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?insight_id=342" target="_blank">DP system</a>. This
                            project lasted 65 days and was completed ahead of the 90 day projection.</p>

                <p> Although a career at sea can be immensely satisfying, it is not for the faint-hearted. In shipping your work hours are called a "watch". A standard watch is 12 hours, this is 7 days a week, and there are no holidays. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTgNn9I6B_s"
                    target="_blank">commercial fishing</a> most watches are 16 hours, and again 7 days a week. This is possible in commercial fishing because crewmen are considered "independent contractors" so you "volunteer" to work more that the 12
                    norm. Generally you are working in brutally cold environments and harsh sea conditions. As a deckhand you can expect to spent your watch outside on deck regardless of the weather conditions. A very tough and dangerous way to make a
                    living! The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfsaf9gh9rc" target="_blank">vessels</a> are extremely high tech employing cutting edge technology to maximize efficiency and streamline the entire process. I started on the deck
                    of commercial fishing vessels where I performed the bosun job for 10yrs before attaining a Mate license and moving to the wheelhouse.</p>

                <p>Commercial shipping on the other hand is different. This sector of marine life is very structured, very regulated, and unionized. This sector is often referred tom a "Merchant Marine" industry encompassing container ships, bulk carriers,
                    and RORO vessels. Unlike commercial fishing, risk taking is frowned upon and there is generally a written procedure for EVERYTHING. With <a href="http://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/history-of-containerization" target="_blank">containerization,</a>                    this sector of the industry has become extremely efficient with an ever increasing safety factor.</p>

                    <p style="font-size:16px;">Offshore supply, commonly refered to as "OSV" work, employs various offshore /platform supply vessels which bring fuel and materials to support oil exploration. Working 12hr shifts, crewmen generally work 21 days on, 21 days off during
                        which time you never leave the vessel...even if it's moored to a dock. Where this is not as dangerous as commercial fishing it has it's own dangers. When on site the vessel must be held in place during cargo operations without
                        a tether or being anchored to the sea floor. Even though the vessel is being held on location it is still moving. As the deck crew loads cargo, everyone must maintain constant vigilence as the shifting vessel can make it extremely
                        difficult to place materials in proper location. Mariners who chose this route are highly credentialed by multiple agencies and are obligated to go through periodic certification re-training.</p>
